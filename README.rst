Python etc, are also supported theoretically, since the language related
plugins are all support kinds of languages.

tabular
=======

Press ``<leader>a`` then given a ``,`` , will make codes align base on ``,`` .
This shortcut is available under normal and visual mode.

ultisnips
=========

With many common code snippets, such as:

- ``c)`` for copyright text.
- ``date`` for ``strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`` .
- ``datetime`` for ``strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")`` .
- ``time`` for ``strftime("%H:%M")`` .
- ``lorem`` for lorem string.
- ``box`` and ``bbox`` for nice box.

Also, customer snippets are provided, which located in directory
``my_snippets/`` :

- ``my_snippets/rst.snippets`` For rst files
- ``my_snippets/c.snippets`` For C/C++ files

All customer snippets use ``tpl`` to create file skecth.

gitgutter
=========

- jump to next hunk (change): ``]c``
- jump to previous hunk (change): ``[c``
- stage the hunk with ``<Leader>hs``
- undo it with ``<Leader>hu``
- preview a hunk's changes with ``<Leader>hp``

The ``.`` command will work with both these with the help of repeat.vim.

A hunk text object is provided which works in visual and operator-pending modes.

``ic`` operates on all lines in the current hunk.
``ac`` operates on all lines in the current hunk and any trailing empty lines.

vim-fugitive

- ``Gcommit`` to commit.
- ``Gpush``   to push.
- ``Gpull`` to pull.
- ``Gdiff`` to diff.

gutentags
=========

gutentags automatically always updates tag files for the project.
We disable this to prevent tag file generation unwanted.

For project needs tag files, just use ``<leader>gt`` to toggle automation
disable/enable.

TODO: Never automatically create tag files, unless explicitly required.
Never update tag files neither, unless there is ones in the project root.

gtags
=====

We use gtags-cscope to replace the build in cscope.
Just use the ``:cscope`` as usual. Notice that ``:cs find d`` command is not
implemented by gtags-cscope.

``:Gtags`` is provide to invoke the global command. Also the the following
shortcuts are provided:

- ``<leader>gl`` list all the tags of the current file
- ``<leader>gd`` goto the definition of the symbol under the cursor
- ``<leader>gr`` list all the reference of the symbol under the cursor
- ``<leader>gi`` jump to files including the current file
- ``<leader>gf`` jump to files under the cursor
- ``<leader>gg`` jump to definition or reference under the cursor

vim-clang-format
================

Use ``<leader>cf`` to format the whole/selected source.
This shortcut is available for both normal and visual mode.

A ``.clang-format`` file is needed. Place one in the project root.

DoxygenToolkit
==============

- ``:Dox`` generate comment for function and class.
- ``:DoxAuthor`` generate author comment. Use ``tpl`` snippet instead.

Draw-it
=======

``<leader>di`` to strat draw, and ``<leader>ds`` to stop.

VOom
====

- For a Markdown file: ``:Voom markdown``
- For LaTeX file: ``:Voom latex``
- For an Orgmode file: ``:Voom org``

``<Tab>`` could be used after ``:Voom`` for file type auto-completion.

Unicode-RST-Tables
==================

- ``<leader><leader>c`` Creates a new restructuredText table.
- ``<leader><leader>f`` Fix table columns in a table.

YouCompleteMe
=============

- ``<C-\>`` trigger the auto completion
- ``<leader>yg`` goto definition or declearation
- ``<leader>yd`` list all the diagnostic informations
- ``<leader>yf`` auto Fix It

The YouCompleteMe GoTo command is smarter than ``GtagsCursor`` which is mapped
to ``<leader>gg`` .
TODO: think about which is better.

denite
======

- ``<leader>df`` to quickly recursively search file in the directory of the
  current buffer.
- ``<leader>db`` to quickly switch buffer.
- ``<leader>dr`` to open files related to the current file.
- ``<C-J>`` ``<C-K>`` to navigate in the Denite interface.

Tips
----

- launch vim from the root of the project.
- pass a list of files as arguments for vim, such as ``vim `git ls-files``` ,
  to open all the source files of the project.
- to search files from the project root, use ``<leader>db`` to search buffers.
- to recursively search files from the current location, use ``<leader>df`` .
- to search relatedd files ( files have the same base name, such as ``foo.cpp``
  ``foo.h``  ``foo_test.cpp`` , are related files), use ``<leader>dr`` .
- see also Ycm's GoTo command( ``<leader>yg`` ), Gtags' P ( ``<leader>gf`` ),
  vim's built in ``gf`` . These are used to goto the file explicitly, 
  while ``<leader>gf`` is a fuzzy search.

***************
TODOs and DONEs
***************

DONEs
=====

- 2018-05-22
    - restructure the whole vimrc.
    - update README
- 2018-05-23
    - outline for the current buffer.
    - related file, header file, implementation file, test file
- 2018-05-24
    - toggle Quickfix window
- 2018-05-26
    - template for new c/c++ header/source files, namespace, include guard, etc.
    - better automatic tag file manager.

DENYs
=====

- gtags outline source for Denite. Using outline means we don't know much about
  the name. Navigation is better than filtering. So, keep the QuickFix style,
  but drop the filtering style.
- run make in the build dir. Use ``make -C /path/to/makefile`` .

TODOs
=====

- language server protocol.
- lint and show the result in a list.
