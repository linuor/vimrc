linuor's vimrc

Less configuration, more defaults.

Mainly focus on C/C++ and restructuredText. Major languages such as Java,
Python etc, are also supported theoretically, since the language related
plugins are all support kinds of languages.

***********
Requirement
***********

- vim with python3 support
- git
- `GNU global <https://www.gnu.org/software/global/>`_ ,
  `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ is recommanded.

- ``cs{mark1}{mark2}`` change {mark1} to ``{mark2}``

tabular
=======

Press ``<leader>a`` then given a ``,`` , will make codes align base on ``,`` .
This shortcut is available under normal and visual mode.

ultisnips
=========

With many common code snippets, such as:

- ``c)`` for copyright text.
- ``date`` for ``strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`` .
- ``datetime`` for ``strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")`` .
- ``time`` for ``strftime("%H:%M")`` .
- ``lorem`` for lorem string.
- ``box`` and ``bbox`` for nice box.

Also, customer snippets are provided, which located in directory
``my_snippets/`` :

- ``my_snippets/rst.snippets`` For rst files
- ``my_snippets/c.snippets`` For C/C++ files

All customer snippets use ``tpl`` to create file skecth.

gitgutter
=========

- jump to next hunk (change): ``]c``
- jump to previous hunk (change): ``[c``
- stage the hunk with ``<Leader>hs``
- undo it with ``<Leader>hu``
- preview a hunk's changes with ``<Leader>hp``

The ``.`` command will work with both these with the help of repeat.vim.

A hunk text object is provided which works in visual and operator-pending modes.

``ic`` operates on all lines in the current hunk.
``ac`` operates on all lines in the current hunk and any trailing empty lines.

vim-fugitive
============

- ``Gstatus`` to get ``git status`` info, and use ``-`` to add/reset files.
- ``Gcommit`` to commit.
- ``Gpush``   to push.
- ``Gpull`` to pull.
- ``Gdiff`` to diff.

gutentags
=========

gutentags automatically always updates tag files for the project.
We disable this to prevent tag file generation unwanted.

For project needs tag files, just use ``<leader>gt`` to toggle automation
disable/enable.

TODO: Never automatically create tag files, unless explicitly required.
Never update tag files neither, unless there is ones in the project root.

gtags
=====

We use gtags-cscope to replace the build in cscope.
Just use the ``:cscope`` as usual. Notice that ``:cs find d`` command is not
implemented by gtags-cscope.

``:Gtags`` is provide to invoke the global command. Also the the following
shortcuts are provided:

- ``<leader>gl`` list all the tags of the current file
- ``<leader>gd`` goto the definition of the symbol under the cursor
- ``<leader>gr`` list all the reference of the symbol under the cursor
- ``<leader>gi`` jump to files including the current file
- ``<leader>gf`` jump to files under the cursor
- ``<leader>gg`` jump to definition or reference under the cursor

vim-clang-format
================

Use ``<leader>cf`` to format the whole/selected source.
This shortcut is available for both normal and visual mode.

A ``.clang-format`` file is needed. Place one in the project root.

DoxygenToolkit
==============

- ``:Dox`` generate comment for function and class.
- ``:DoxAuthor`` generate author comment. Use ``tpl`` snippet instead.

Draw-it
=======

``<leader>di`` to strat draw, and ``<leader>ds`` to stop.

VOom
====

- For a Markdown file: ``:Voom markdown``
- For LaTeX file: ``:Voom latex``
- For an Orgmode file: ``:Voom org``

``<Tab>`` could be used after ``:Voom`` for file type auto-completion.

Unicode-RST-Tables
==================

- ``<leader><leader>c`` Creates a new restructuredText table.
- ``<leader><leader>f`` Fix table columns in a table.

YouCompleteMe
=============

- ``<C-\>`` trigger the auto completion
- ``<leader>yg`` goto definition or declearation
- ``<leader>yd`` list all the diagnostic informations
- ``<leader>yf`` auto Fix It

The YouCompleteMe GoTo command is smarter than ``GtagsCursor`` which is mapped
to ``<leader>gg`` .
TODO: think about which is better.

denite
======

- ``<leader>df`` to quickly recursively search file in the directory of the
  current buffer.
- ``<leader>db`` to quickly switch buffer.
- ``<leader>dr`` to open files related to the current file.
- ``<C-J>`` ``<C-K>`` to navigate in the Denite interface.

Tips
----

- launch vim from the root of the project.
- pass a list of files as arguments for vim, such as ``vim `git ls-files``` ,
  to open all the source files of the project.
- to search files from the project root, use ``<leader>db`` to search buffers.
- to recursively search files from the current location, use ``<leader>df`` .
- to search relatedd files ( files have the same base name, such as ``foo.cpp``
  ``foo.h``  ``foo_test.cpp`` , are related files), use ``<leader>dr`` .
- see also Ycm's GoTo command( ``<leader>yg`` ), Gtags' P ( ``<leader>gf`` ),
  vim's built in ``gf`` . These are used to goto the file explicitly, 
  while ``<leader>gf`` is a fuzzy search.

***************
TODOs and DONEs
***************

DONEs
=====

- 2018-05-22
    - restructure the whole vimrc.
    - update README
- 2018-05-23
    - outline for the current buffer.
    - related file, header file, implementation file, test file
- 2018-05-24
    - toggle Quickfix window
- 2018-05-26
    - template for new c/c++ header/source files, namespace, include guard, etc.
    - better automatic tag file manager.

DENYs
=====

- gtags outline source for Denite. Using outline means we don't know much about
  the name. Navigation is better than filtering. So, keep the QuickFix style,
  but drop the filtering style.

TODOs
=====

- language server protocol.
- lint and show the result in a list.
- run make in the build dir.
